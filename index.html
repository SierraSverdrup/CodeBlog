                This assignment was challenging in using VS Code with Github.
                I was able to using the terminal within VS Code to clone my repository
                 and then push the assignment. But, I am unsure if there is a way to 
                 connect my engineering server terminal to open VS code. The teacher was
                  the biggest resource in completing this assignment.

            <p>
                This assignment was challenging in many aspects. It took much longer than
                the first assignment, for one. Secondly, I used resources like Stack Overflow
                 in order to fix errors in my styling because I did not have time to go to 
                 office hours. I found that as I put more time into the assignment, it became
                 much easier. When I began, it was overwhelming not knowing where to begin.

            <h2>Entry 3</h2>

            <p>
                The most difficult portion of this assignment was the filters sidebar. I ran
                into multiple issues, like selecting the live elements and then making those
                an array rather than an HTML collection so that I could use a forEach loop. This
                required me to google some information, but I found success after some trial and
                error. The other part that I had to google was how to create an array of all
                of the checked elements in a checkbox. I learned a lot about how the selectors
                you choose to manipulate the DOM matter a lot.

                This assignment was very challenging for me. The most difficult part was figuring out how
                to install all of the dependencies on my machine and learning how handlebars interacts 
                with a server and different files. It was very challenging for me to know where to start 
                with this project. The clarity came once I understood the overview of the project sectioning.
                By this I mean learning how each handlebars file interacts with each other like with partials.
