                This assignment was challenging in using VS Code with Github.
                I was able to using the terminal within VS Code to clone my repository
                 and then push the assignment. But, I am unsure if there is a way to 
                 connect my engineering server terminal to open VS code. The teacher was
                  the biggest resource in completing this assignment.

                This assignment was challenging in many aspects. It took much longer than
                the first assignment, for one. Secondly, I used resources like Stack Overflow
                 in order to fix errors in my styling because I did not have time to go to 
                 office hours. I found that as I put more time into the assignment, it became
                 much easier. When I began, it was overwhelming not knowing where to begin.
