                This assignment was challenging in using VS Code with Github.
                I was able to using the terminal within VS Code to clone my repository
                 and then push the assignment. But, I am unsure if there is a way to 
                 connect my engineering server terminal to open VS code. The teacher was
                  the biggest resource in completing this assignment.
